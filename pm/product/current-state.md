# Current State — Weft Federation        Checkpoint: 2026-06-26 (Tenter (renamed Shuttle) → next federation bid PDR-0032; product workspace + Plainweave member-docs COMMITTED; built on the 06-25 federation sweep)

## The bet right now — launch DELIVERED; the new Now still needs a DECIDE
**The FIVE-member clean-break cutover `weft-4b2f948f70` SHIPPED 2026-06-17** (epic closed
01:24Z); all five members on `main` + PyPI. Accepted/done — **no longer the Now bet.** The one
outward-facing tail, the **public announcement, remains owner-reserved** (not recorded as made —
escalation #1).

**The next Now bet is NOT yet chosen (a DECIDE act).** Front-runner: **seam-health surface**
`weft-b6effe30f9` (P1 epic, owner-validated as the credibility gap). Contenders below.

## Federation sweep 2026-06-25 — three live storylines (members moving fast; pace ~a release/day)
All movement is additive/patch-shaped (contracts-inviolate guardrail intact), but the cross-member
contract changes that SHIPPED need a hub blast-radius reconcile (flagged below).

**① Verification-freshness (Warpline "Rung 2") — the dominant cross-member thread.**
- **Warpline** `plan/verification-freshness` (~18 commits, in-flight): `v4 verification_events` table,
  `compose_verification_freshness`, new **`verify-record` verb (2nd mutating tool)**, advisory per-item
  verify + stale-first sort, GV-VF-1 vector. Plan-reviewed v1→v3 approved; not merged.
- **Filigree → SHIPPED 3.1.0**: per-issue **commit anchor** at claim/close (warpline seam, **schema v29**),
  **issue-lifecycle facts on the reverse-lookup** ("warpline b-ii"), atomic reverify ingest.
- **Legis → SHIPPED 1.2.0**: forge-proof per-SEI **`attestation_get`** (Task 8 ratified), advisory-boundary spine.
- **✓ Reconciled 2026-06-25:** `weft-7673e1fa79` retitled to the one remaining piece (**Wardline** resolved-
  finding read) + bumped P2, with Filigree/Legis halves recorded shipped. Legis advisory-preflight consumer
  `weft-13df44db31` **CLOSED** (shipped Legis 1.2.0, PDR-0002/0003).

**② Federation seam-conformance push (bottom-up from the members) — seam-health territory.**
- **Wardline** `feat/weft-seam-conformance` (~12 commits): **P0 enforceable weft seam registry + fail-closed
  gate**, multiple seams "reaching at_bar" (qualname parity, SEI loomweave→wardline, 3 consumer seams, MCP
  B1/B2, suppression-filter), single-sourced federation-status envelope + shared `WeftHttp` transport.
- **Filigree** `feat/weft-suppression-conformance`: consumer-side conformance oracle for the suppression seam.
- **✓ Tracked 2026-06-25:** new hub anchor `weft-b5dde278b9` (under the seam-health epic `weft-b6effe30f9`)
  captures the wardline + filigree seam-conformance program — it was untracked in the hub (0 search hits).

**③ Loomweave Rust plugin (ADR-054) — unblocks Plainweave.**
- Reachability-root tags, framework handlers, pub-method rooting, real-corpus dogfood (on `main`, **+6 unpushed**).
  **This is the upstream fix for Plainweave's north-star Rust-tagging blocker** — partly resolves that DECIDE.

**Quiet:** **tabard** static since 06-16 (gap-named, held). **plainweave** 1.0.0 local/no-remote (push gate, below).

## Tenter (renamed Shuttle) — lined up as the next federation bid (PDR-0032, 2026-06-26)
**Decision this session.** Shuttle (parked 06-25 as a shelf-life feature) is **renamed Tenter** ("Shuttle" is
taken) and **revived as a distinct member candidate**, lined up as the **next federation bid** (roadmap *Next*;
federation/roster track — members run their own bids). It owns one artifact: the change as a **rendered,
spine-bound, drift-checked plan object** (the *HOW*), composing with Filigree (*WHAT*) + Plainweave (*WHY*) into an
**advisory operating picture of a change** — explicitly NOT a workflow/approval/execution engine (that trips the §6
central-orchestrator anti-goal; teeth, if ever, are Legis's). Read-only, pure dependency-sink, enrich-only.
Plan-steps **reference/propose** Plainweave requirements, never mint them (durable Plainweave slice = prospective
intent-coverage). **Gated on prove-the-need** (one real change — elspeth 2,800-line plan baseline) **+ §7 admission
(owner-reserved)**; no `~/tenter` repo until admitted. Doctrine §2/§8 Shuttle→Tenter rewrite is propagation-tail,
gated on admission. See **PDR-0032**.

## Plainweave fold-in — ADMITTED this session (reframed/renamed Charter)
**Plainweave = the code-grounded-intent / requirements member, reframed code-up ("permission for code to
exist") and renamed from Charter.** Reframe+rename owner-approved 06-18 (hub `16d81a0`); **§7 admission +
the canon rename RATIFIED 2026-06-24 (owner AskUserQuestion "Ratify Plainweave only" → [PDR-0030]
(decisions/0030-ratify-plainweave-code-grounded-intent.md)).** **Still owner-gated:** public remote /
PyPI publish + final name.
- Stood up at `~/plainweave` (`2bb8644`, main); pre-alpha; **not** in the cutover; **non-gating**.
- **Cross-member seam validated on LIVE peers (Lacuna, Loomweave)** — Plainweave PDR-008 — the
  intent graph (`SEI → requirement → goal`, orphan/trace/corpus) reproduces on real peer catalogs,
  not stubs. Read primitives shipped: `entity-intent-context` (goal_trail) + honest `intent-coverage`.
  This earned-in-shipped-behaviour seam is why admission rests on more than a reserved coordinate (vs Tabard).
- Plainweave-side active bet: scope the public-surface denominator + surface `coverage.complete` so the
  north-star is honestly computable (catalog public-surface tagging is per-repo).
- **Canon — member docs COMMITTED (`4c938b1`), doctrine/registries DEFERRED:** `members/plainweave.md`
  (supersedes charter.md → redirect stub) + the `members/warpline.md` snapshot are committed. The
  doctrine §1/§2/§5/§6/§7/§8/§9 + `registries/claims.md` (C-1/C-12/C-13 + new C-16) + `registries/terminology.md`
  Charter→Plainweave rename is **applied in the working tree but NOT yet committed** — those files co-carry the
  still-held Tabard edits and co-edit the member-count lines, so a clean *Plainweave-only* commit needs the ~3
  fused lines de-fused via `git apply --cached` (git-stash + `add -p` unavailable here). Do not commit Tabard as a side effect.

## Parallel thread — identity / Tabard (OWNER-GATED, canon edits still UNCOMMITTED)
Tabard (the *who* coordinate) progressed from idea to **scaffolded pre-alpha 0.0.1a0** (`2108cf1`, main):
federation spec drafted for hub review, name-reservation scaffold, CI/release workflow, and an intake
round (warpline is bidirectional — *gives* the `when` axis, *consumes* actor-resolution; PDR-0002/0003 in
Tabard's own tracker). **Hub canon edits remain UNCOMMITTED / owner-gated:** doctrine §2/§6/§7/§9 +
`registries/claims.md` (C-1, C-4, +C-15) + `registries/terminology.md` + untracked `members/tabard.md`
are all in the working tree, never committed. PDR-0028 (proposed). Does NOT gate anything now.

## Proposed next bets (contenders for the new Now — for DECIDE, not committed)
1. **Seam-health surface** `weft-b6effe30f9` (epic, P1) — interrogable federation joins; PDR-0023
   central feature; owner-validated as the credibility gap (its *absence* is the gap). **Front-runner.**
   Now has 11 children, incl. the wardline→legis seam item.
2. **L2 / fleet-OS coordination plane** — PDR-0024 two-mode surface (bulletin + chat), gated to a
   dogfood/falsifier proof before Adopted.
3. **Make the loop honest — scoreboard + close-the-loop** `weft-6636667996` / `weft-ff30fd979f` —
   re-triaged 06-21: re-aim the scoreboard from correctness/dogfood-pass-rate to **first-reach share +
   defection-return** (behavioural adoption, per-model/longitudinal). The north-star re-aim enabler.
4. **FD-1: Warpline observed/dynamic call edges → Loomweave upstream-caller fold-in** `weft-5a484165bd`
   (feature, P1, ACCEPTED 06-17) — a third enrich-only SEI-keyed fold (mirrors taint/issue folds);
   serves the beat-grep north-star AND operationalizes Warpline "earns its place." Cross-member.
5. **Agent continuity & write-safety** (A/A′/B/C, PDR-0008) — signed off; build follows launch, unblocked.

**Exploration (pre-shaping):** interface-define-and-assure (wardline + legis) — declare an interface
contract in JSON, have wardline + legis assure conformance; internal-first. Candidate to fold into
seam-health (#1).

## Warpline 5th-producer handover (2026-06-22) — triaged this session
Warpline delivered a handover (`~/warpline/docs/integration/2026-06-22-warpline-5th-producer-handover.md`):
wire it in as the **5th producer of the GS-7 conformance oracle** + a **glossary-freeze**, plus reciprocal
cross-member integration asks. OD-5 (fold into GS-7) is already resolved-direction (owner nod 06-13). All
triaged into the tracker (label `warpline-handover`); nothing punted invisibly:
- **`weft-13f84c77c5`** (P1) — GS-7 5th-producer wiring (mount 18 golden vectors + run executable, register
  producer `warpline`/`warpline.golden_vectors.v1`, gate on exit). **Gate-activation = owner runbook act**,
  sequenced behind the freeze ruling.
- **`weft-12410be4e2`** (P1, owner-gate) — the glossary-freeze ruling (escalation #2, below).
- **`weft-670ec2fe90`** Loomweave-temporal **bumped P3→P1** (beat-grep north-star); Wardline `weft-843fb82b57`
  + Legis `weft-13df44db31` → P2; Plainweave (ex-Charter) `weft-20b486b4e8` retitled, stays P3/future.
- **`weft-b7c23bfcae`** (P2, NEW) — Filigree consumes reverify worklists (the one untracked a-part).
- **`weft-7673e1fa79`** (P3, future-contingent) — the reciprocal Rung-2 "proven-good" enablers (Filigree
  `closed_at`, Wardline resolved-finding timestamp, Legis per-SEI attestation read); gated on Warpline
  actually building Rung 2 (prove-the-need).

## Open questions / escalations (owner-reserved)
- **🚩 Public launch announcement** — cutover SHIPPED + on PyPI, but the announcement is owner-reserved
  and NOT recorded as made. Has it gone out / should it? (outward-facing gate.)
- **✅ Warpline glossary-freeze ruling (escalation #2) — RESOLVED** `weft-12410be4e2` (closed; **PDR-0031**).
  Owner SIGNED the freeze attestation of the existing closed surface AND BLESSED `enrichment_reasons` as a
  v1-compatible additive top-level key (verified shipped in v1.2.0 under the v1 URIs); strict line reaffirmed
  (closed-vocab/error-code/reason-class changes still need v2). Residual: Warpline's 1.2.1 fixture patch
  (warpline-fc09bdeddd) must land before the GS-7 gate flips; gate-activation `weft-13f84c77c5` stays the
  owner's runbook act.
- **✅ Plainweave §7 admission — RESOLVED.** Owner ratified ("Ratify Plainweave only", PDR-0030); canon rename
  applied (member docs committed this checkpoint; doctrine/registries still held — see below). Residual owner
  gates: **publish / public remote / final name** (held).
- **🚩 Plainweave PyPI publish — CONFIRMED GATE EVENT (verified on PyPI 06-26).** **`plainweave` 1.0.0 IS LIVE
  on public PyPI** (`pypi.org/project/plainweave`, releases `['1.0.0']`) — verified, not just the `d0a7700`
  commit prose (plainweave PDR-012). The hub gate marks Plainweave **publish / public-remote owner-reserved**
  (vision grant + `members/plainweave.md`, which still reads "not published"). A member loop (or out-of-band
  action) crossed the owner gate. Outward-facing + already-done → **owner reconcile, NOT actioned from
  checkpoint:** ratify-after-the-fact (+ correct the canon) or yank. NB the public name "plainweave" now
  partly settles the held *final-name* gate by fait accompli.
- **🚩 Tabard canon still owner-gated** — the uncommitted doctrine §2/§6/§7/§9 + registries (C-1/C-4/C-15) +
  `members/tabard.md` edits remain held (PDR-0028 proposed). The owner chose Plainweave-only, so Tabard
  waits. NB: doctrine + registries now carry BOTH the (ratified) Plainweave edits and the (held) Tabard
  edits, co-editing the member-count lines — checkpoint must commit Plainweave WITHOUT committing Tabard.
- **wardline→legis seam** `weft-af0787892c` — **partially resolved:** now parented under seam-health
  `weft-b6effe30f9`, re-triaged 06-21. The "legis has no per-SEI read transport" premise is **stale**
  (legis 1.1.1 ships `override_list(entity=SEI)`); remaining gap = **Warpline wiring** (still passes
  `legis_client=None`). Additive (new read path) — ships solo. *No longer an open classify question.*
- **loomweave's two federation-touching changes** (parked in tickets, owner-reported 06-18) — still
  **TODO: confirm the two ticket IDs** (likely loomweave's own member tracker) carry a dated analysis
  plan + blast-radius map before any contract moves (federation change discipline).
- C-9 `weft-a2f4cf95c7` stale codex claim (release/reclaim).

## This checkpoint did (2026-06-26)
- **DECIDED + recorded the Tenter (renamed Shuttle) ruling — PDR-0032:** distinct member candidate; the
  Filigree+Plainweave+Tenter **advisory operating picture of a change** (NOT an orchestrator); plan→Plainweave
  links are references/proposals, never mints; dependency-sink + enrich-only carried. **Lined up as the next
  federation bid** (roadmap *Next*), gated on prove-the-need + §7 admission.
- **COMMITTED** the long-stranded product workspace (two sessions' worth) + the Plainweave **member docs**
  (`members/plainweave.md`, `charter.md` stub, `warpline.md` snapshot) + PDR-0030/0031/0032 + the 06-25
  realization doc. First commit of this state — HEAD was stuck at `7503a44` across the 06-24 and 06-25 sessions.
- **FOLDED into** the parallel 06-25 federation-sweep brief (did not clobber it); refreshed the stamp to 06-26
  HEADs (loomweave/legis/plainweave moved again mid-checkpoint).
- **DEFERRED the fused canon** (`doctrine.md`, `registries/*`): the Plainweave rename is line-fused with the
  owner-gated Tabard edits on the member-count lines — de-fusing safely (no `git add -p`, no stash here) is a
  deliberate act, not a checkpoint side-effect. Held as the top follow-up.
- **Surfaced escalations:** the Plainweave-PyPI possible gate-breach (new) + the standing announcement / Tabard /
  publish gates.

## Next session, start here
1. **De-fuse + commit the Plainweave doctrine/registries rename** WITHOUT the held Tabard edits — the member-count
   lines in `doctrine.md` §1, `registries/claims.md` C-1, `registries/terminology.md` name BOTH Plainweave
   (admitted) and Tabard (held) in one sentence, so a clean commit needs those ~3 lines rewritten to the
   Plainweave-only state via `git apply --cached` (working tree keeps the held Tabard delta). Verify
   `git diff --cached -- doctrine.md registries members/tabard.md | grep -i tabard` is empty before committing.
2. **Owner escalations (below):** Plainweave-PyPI publish (verify + authorize/yank); the public announcement;
   Tabard §7 admission (PDR-0028, held); Plainweave residual gates (remote / name).
3. **Pick the active Now bet** (DECIDE) — seam-health `weft-b6effe30f9` (front-runner; already under bottom-up
   construction `weft-b5dde278b9`). Then `/write-prd` + `/axiom-program-management`.
4. **Schedule Tenter prove-the-need** — point a read-only staging surface at one real change (elspeth plan
   baseline) before any §7 admission.
5. **Confirm loomweave's two parked federation tickets** carry dated blast-radius maps; propagation tail of
   PDR-0030 (federation-map.md, SHIPPING.md, web/ IA, conflict-register).
