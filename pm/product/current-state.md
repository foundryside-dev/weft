# Current State — Weft Federation        Checkpoint: 2026-07-01 (2nd) — **SEAM STEWARDSHIP RECLAIMED hub-side** (PDR-0045; `weft-dbaada5883` in_progress): canonical seam-index authored at `contracts/seam-index.json` (catalog+blessing, NOT a verdict store), registered in contracts-index.md; wardline's `seam_registry.json` declared a producer-contributed MIRROR; steward role dissolved + 3 cross-sibling rulings re-homed (reverify→PDR-0037; conforms-down→NEWLY ratified PDR-0045; false-freeze→verified RESOLVED, closes PDR-0038 cond 3). Ticket's sync-lint mechanism CUT (backwards + never built). REMAINING: wardline prose PR `weft-83c25d96e3` (dated 07-08, merge-grant, gate-neutral) + legis oracle re-freeze `weft-51699a641c` (07-15). — Prior 07-01: Warpline 5th-producer handover EXECUTED (PDR-0043): glossary-freeze ATTESTED v1; "GS-7 gate" reframed to the DISTRIBUTED reality (warpline self-gates = parity DONE; consumer rechecks legis✅/wardline✅; filigree+loomweave oracle gaps filed weft-87443311a0/weft-7931a32599; NO central flip). Plainweave 1.2.1 shipped the fable-dogfood error-legibility fixes; requirements_enrichment→warpline half-seam BUILT+LIVE (closed). + **scan_manifest seam (AMBER-2) BUILT+RELEASED+BLESSED+CLOSED (PDR-0044)** — the audit's clearest half-seam, done (wardline v1.2.0 ↔ plainweave, live-e2e confirmed). Prior (06-29): both seam REDs landed (PDR-0041); half-seam build-out (PDR-0042); merge-grant.

## The bet right now — FABRIC-FIRST (PDR-0035, unchanged)
**(1) fill the missed stitches + (2) stabilize Plainweave's landing in sibling APIs.** Full-Tenter
stays deferred (PDR-0034). · metric: enrich-only guardrail stays 0 (**06-29 audit confirmed 0
load-bearing deps across all 7 members**) + the FILL-NOW queue draws down.

## In flight (by ID)
- **Bid-1 churn → DONE/LANDED.** `weft-670ec2fe90` + validation `weft-6fc4a166dc` + deadlock bug
  `weft-e585382ff3` all CLOSED (loomweave `a980ef2`, live-validated on lacuna, 564 tests).
- **Bid-2 legis preflight → HELD (open `weft-46b2f002fa`).** NOT independently merged — it's the
  ancestor of the active `refactor/decouple-layering-inversions` branch; lands via that branch
  (whoever lands it bumps version 1.3.0→1.3.1 + closes). Rationale on the ticket.
- **2 seam REDs → both LANDED+CLOSED (PDR-0041).** `weft-0678843f13` closure-gate drift fixed via
  filigree #71 → main `9b50143` (filigree owns current-code-vs-attach drift per hub ruling;
  discriminated-UNKNOWN degrade verified in-code). `weft-d5091cba12` plainweave boundary-lie fixed
  via plainweave #6 → main `9b5fc88` (read-enrich now resolve_identity_local; non-vacuity verified).
  **Axis-2 confident-wrong seams now 0.** RED-1 children stay OPEN: `weft-537cd52792` legis comment
  (FOLD into 1.4.0, not standalone), `weft-dbd0584a4d` loomweave oracle additive, `weft-aee5769607`
  P3 hardening (loomweave_known_down cascade bound + live e2e seam test).
- **Bid-2 next:** `scan_manifest` contract `weft-9a35aa00e7` — audit found the RESOLUTION PATH: lift
  wardline's existing `scan_scope` (in the signed legis artifact) into a standalone manifest + alias
  the field names (covered_paths/ruleset_id). Hub-bless before plainweave builds the adapter.
- **FILL-NOW remainder (gates met, not started):** Warpline→Legis `governance_for_sei`
  `weft-af0787892c` (premise dissolved — likely just close); Wardline affected-scan tail
  `weft-843fb82b57`; legis-reverify DROP `weft-5cbe6bc11b` (PDR-0037, execute).
- **Seam-conformance (PDR-0038):** program `weft-b5dde278b9` — **RECONCILED**. wardline's `seam_registry.json`
  + gate ARE on main (the "on merge, reconcile" trigger fired). The reclaim `weft-dbaada5883` closed it hub-side
  (**PDR-0045**, in_progress): hub-owned canon `contracts/seam-index.json`, wardline demoted to producer-mirror,
  steward role dissolved, 3 rulings re-homed. Remaining = wardline prose PR `weft-83c25d96e3` → `git grep -i
  steward` == 0 on wardline main closes cond 2. + legis oracle re-freeze `weft-51699a641c`.

## This checkpoint did (2026-06-29, 2nd)
- **Landed + closed both seam REDs** (PDR-0041). Reconciliation found both already fixed on green,
  isolated, conflict-free PRs (filigree #71, plainweave #6) opened that morning by a concurrent
  session. Verified the checks CI can't self-certify (RED-1 discriminated-UNKNOWN degrade path; RED-2
  non-vacuous local resolution), confirmed release workflows are tag-gated (merge publishes nothing),
  merged both with owner approval, walked the bugs through their real lifecycle to `closed` with
  commit anchors. **Axis-2 honesty: 2 confident-wrong seams → 0.**
- **Recorded the owner merge-grant** (PDR-0041 / auto-memory): hub may merge member PRs without
  per-merge approval; release-tagging stays owner-gated. Encoded in `.claude/settings.local.json`
  (`Bash(gh pr merge:*)` allow, `Bash(gh release:*)` deny).
- **Surfaced the stale-brief root cause** (PDR-0041): the prior checkpoint reconciled against main
  HEADs, not open PRs → missed the two ready fixes. New rule: resume+checkpoint survey open PRs per
  member. Refreshed metrics (enrich-only RED row → fixed).
- **Commissioned the half-seam build-out** (PDR-0042) on owner directive — umbrella `weft-06ab23e656`
  with 4 prove-need exploration spikes for the producer-with-no-consumer seams (audit §3).
- (Prior, same day) Ran the 7-member audit (PDR-0039); disposed both Bid fills (PDR-0040).

## Open questions / escalations (owner-reserved — carried forward, none NEW this session)

- **🚩 Canon de-fuse + `members/plainweave.md` "not published" correction** — AUTHORIZED (PDR-0036)
  but HELD with the Tabard canon (doctrine/registries fuse both; de-fuse the ~3 member-count lines
  Plainweave-only via `git apply --cached`; verify `git diff --cached -- doctrine.md registries
  members/tabard.md | grep -i tabard` empty).
- **✅ GS-7 / warpline 5th-producer** `weft-13f84c77c5` — EXECUTED 2026-07-01 (PDR-0043): freeze
  attested v1; warpline self-gates (parity); NO central flip (GS-7 is distributed per-consumer CI).
  Residual = 2 consumer-oracle gaps (`weft-87443311a0` filigree, `weft-7931a32599` loomweave); ticket
  stays open until both land. Follow-up: tick warpline's §4 freeze checkboxes.
- **🚩 Tabard §7 admission** (PDR-0028 proposed) + public naming — held. (Audit: tabard is honest
  name-reservation pre-alpha, nothing wired, nothing depends on it.)
- **✅ announcement = DONE 06-28; website deploy = LIVE 06-28** (both closed; optional cosmetic
  index.astro lifts remain, cherry-pick-only).

## Next session, start here

> **FIRST: `gh pr list` per member (non-dependabot) — do NOT reconcile against main HEADs alone
> (PDR-0041 stale-brief lesson).** At 06-29 the other open PRs were concurrent-session work, NOT
> mine to land: legis #21 (release/1.3.0) + #22 (policy-boundary fix); plainweave #4 (release/1.2.0);
> warpline #2 (verification-freshness) + #3 (release/1.2.0); wardline has a flood of automated
> Sentinel/Bolt bot PRs (#39–#77) — triage-or-ignore, not hub work.

1. **Seam reclaim (`weft-dbaada5883`, in_progress):** land the wardline prose PR `weft-83c25d96e3` (reword
   steward→PDR-0037/0045, add mirror note, drop sync-lint direction; merge-grant, gate-neutral) → then `git grep
   -i steward` == 0 on wardline main closes cond 2 → close `weft-dbaada5883`. Also `weft-51699a641c` (legis oracle).
   ~~**Bless `scan_manifest`** `weft-9a35aa00e7`~~ **DONE 2026-07-01 (PDR-0044).** Built+released
   both sides (wardline v1.2.0 emits `weft.wardline.scan_manifest.v1` header line; plainweave adapter
   consumes it), live-e2e confirmed, hub-blessed, ticket CLOSED. Unblocks plainweave wardline-peer-facts
   (half-seam #3). NB the bless lives in PDR-0044 (no hub seam-index yet — pending `weft-dbaada5883`).
2. **FILL-NOW remainder:** close `weft-af0787892c` (premise dissolved); `weft-843fb82b57`; execute
   legis-reverify DROP `weft-5cbe6bc11b` (PDR-0037). Promote the latent `filigree.rs` framing bug
   (loomweave 30549a3 follow-up) to a dated ticket.
3. **RED-1 children** (now the live seam-health follow-ups): `weft-dbd0584a4d` loomweave oracle
   additive (ships solo); `weft-aee5769607` P3 hardening; `weft-537cd52792` legis comment — confirm
   it FOLDS into legis 1.4.0, don't land standalone.
4. **Confirm Bid-2 preflight landed** on legis main via the refactor branch; if not by next checkpoint,
   escalate (PDR-0040 reversal trigger).
5. **Build-out exploration: the 4 half-seams** (umbrella `weft-06ab23e656`, PDR-0042) — producer-with-
   no-consumer spikes: `weft-88a9559a0f` loomweave lineage, `weft-fa5b23e8c9` callers/callees (→FD-1),
   `weft-61c55deab9` plainweave wardline_peer_facts, `weft-0718035e5e` requirements_enrichment→warpline.
   Each: prove-need → build / terminal-by-design / park. P2 (do NOT displace the P1 fabric-first path).
6. **Re-run/refresh the audit** once wardline seam-conformance + the legis refactor land on main
   (snapshot was mid-flight). Owner escalations below (canon de-fuse; GS-7; Tabard §7).
   - **⚠ Doc-only gaps (offered-to-file, not yet ticketed — don't invisibly punt, PDR-0042):**
     AMBER-3 (wardline file-artifact bare fingerprint → plainweave silent join-miss) + AMBER-8
     (filigree hard-blocks on loomweave registry for scan-ingest — the enrich-only guardrail's watch).
